case a return to the reading of the Bembine and other
good codd. Om- obligations are more especially due
to the critical ed. of Umpfenbach and that of the
Phormio by Dziatsz. The Bembine being at once
so important and so inaccurately coHated, we have
placed in the margin a short critical commentmy, in
which its evidence for and against the main points of

Our best thanks are due to Mr Edward Bond, Fellow
of Queen⁷s College, Oxford, for his revision and emen-
dation of the Introduction: and to Professor Jebb for
his kind permission to make use of his spirited trans-

lation of Act 3 Scene 1.
