 

INTRODUC'TION. ix

Roman literature it is successful imitation rather than
any new glory of creation which forms the boast of
those authors whom we account the greatest. Tragedy
is not the expression of the deep and solemn vein
which runs through all the history of Rome : comedy—
at least, comedy of the highest sort—is not a reflex of
the national life 3 Catullus is dubbed ‘doctus,' the techni-
cal epithet for one skilled in Greek lore; Vergil⁵ boasts
that he has sung Hesiod in Roman cities‚ and Horace
tunes to native strings the songs of another land.
There is no reason to be astonished at this ; it is only
to say that a nation whose genius prompted deeds of
war, conquest, legislation and administrative power,
whose constructive and artistic faculty found its truest
expression in substanti-<tl colossal works of utility‚ was
not fitted to achieve success in fields where subtlety of
thought or spiritual imagination was required. Roman
laws, Roman aqueductS, Roman roads: these are Ro-
man indeedj, but Roman literature draws from abroad
the sources of its life and strength.

Of the ‘celestial thieves' who stole fire from Hellas
for the uses of Rome, Terence was among Terence Mt„
the most successful. His short life of 25 greekfffflggffcffl
or, as was once thought, of 35 years⁶ ‘'
witnessed a most direct and determined attempt to
bring in a higher culture and more definitely Greek
influence. This was not to be done in a moment:
Naevius the recognised champion of the rugged Satur-
nian metre, eminently national in his epic on the F irst
Punic War, the poet who wrote his own epitaph to

⁶ Georg. 2, 176, Ascraeumque cano Romana per oppida
cargzeffitschl' Teuffel, Wagner and other modern writers give
the later date (184 Rc.) for his birth: basing their opinion on
the authority of the best MSS. of Suetonius, where, in his life
of Terence, he says: nondam quintum atque uicesimum egressus
aurium.
