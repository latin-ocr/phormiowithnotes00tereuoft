Against him and his supporber Fabius were ranged
than large body of cultivated, able and infiuenbial men,
who are known to us as the Scipionic circle, which
comprised, among others, O. Sulpicius Gallus, Fabius
Labeo, M. Popilius Laenas, Spurius Mummius, L.
Furius Philo, Minucius, Metellus, and, most celebrated
of all, the great Laelius ‘of mellowed wisdom' and the
fubure hero of Carthage‚ Scipio the younger. These
were formidable antagonisfis‚ and they seb to work to
mould the national taste tc conformity with Greek
moclels. They had with them Polybius the Greek
historian (13.0. 208-127), a valuable ally, inasmuch as
his work quitted the old lines on which Roman history
was constructed‚ and took a wider and more philo-
sophical basis: and in their earlier efforts they made
use of the extraordinary talents of Pvssmvs TEREN'rIvs

a Roman senator.
