INTBODUCTION. xi

Slaves in those times were often of gentler birth and
wider culture than their masters: but judging from the
extreme purity of his latinity, unobscured and unde-
filed by any trace of barbarism, it seems likely that
Terence was brought over in his early childhood: he
therefore owed to his master his liberal education,
granted doubtless all the more freely that he gave
token of future greatness. Admitted to the society
and close sriendship of Scipio and Laelius and other
patrons of mark he had every opportunity for en-
larging his culture and achieving dramatic success.
Detractors were not wanting to put the most dis-
honourable sense on this attachment of the great 3
others, again, tried to rob the dramatist of his well-
earned laurels by insinuating that the works issued in
Terence's name were not absolutely his own, but that
he received materia] assistance in their composition
from his patrons. The poet himself seems to allow
that there was some foundation for this charge, in the
prologue to one of his plays¹⁰:—

Nam quod isti dicunt maliuoli, homines nobilis

hunc adiutare adsidueque una scribere:

quod illi maledictum uemens esse existumant

eam laudem hic ducit maxumam, quom illis placet

qui nobis uniuorsis et populo placent,

quorum opera in bello rin otio in neyotio,

suo quisque tempore usias-t sine superbia.
It is impossible to believe that these words of high
praise can have been applied to Laelius and Scipio, as
at that date they hardly deserved them: further, if we
adopt the earlier date for Terence’s birth, these patrons
were his juniors, and therefore unable or unlikely to
have helped him. Still the evidence is unmistakeable
that he received some extraneous help.

Six comedies have come down to us: the Andria,

Eunuchus, Heautontimorumenos, Phormio, His works.

1⁰ Prol. Adelphoe, 15—20.
