Hecyra and Adelphi. Of these the Andria is the most
pathetic‚ the Eunuchus the most lively (a quality which
made it popular and lucrative to its author¹¹) and the
The Hecyra. Hecyra unquestionably the worst. We
may indeed dismiss the theory advocated by Wagner¹²
that its ill success was due to the virtuous character
displayed by a courtesan, whose genereus interference
brings the play to a happy deuouement. We have
Terence’s own testimony that it was hissed off the
stage long before the end had been reached. Its pro-
logue gives us its history and tells how it was removed
because the audience preferred a boxing-match, a com-
bat ofgladiators and the prospect of the performances
of a ropedancer. The fact was that the Roman popu-
lace was anything but literary, and would at any
moment have turned away from the comparatively
Severe pleasure of a drama, written in Terence's
style, to the excitement of shows and prizefighting.
The popular taste universally would postpone the
pleasure of the mind to that of the eye. Moreover‚
the Hecyra is singularly wanting in action and 13
rendered tedious by a soliloquy of inordinate length.

pathetic and even solemn kind.
