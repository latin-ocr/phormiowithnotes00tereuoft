this anecdote: unless we suppose that the play was
not represented till two years after this incident.
Caecilius died in 168 Β. 8., and the first representation
of the Andria is placed in 166 Β. O. ¹⁴.

We may reasonably credit Suetonius' statement
that Terence died possessed of a small property on
the Appian road : he speaks, however, in the prologue
to the Phormio as though living were rather a pre-
carious and difficult matter: yet in the main his plays
were successful and his patrous of sufficient wealth
to keep him from want. His chief enemy was an
older contemporary poet named Luscius Lanuvinus,
to whom he alludes in every prologue except that
of 1118 Hecyra. His main charges were lst, want of
originality: this has been already alluded wzanoesayainst
to in the connection with Scipio and strem-
Laelius: 2nd, contaminatio or the practice of taking
portions from two or more plays of 011181 authors and
working them up together. Terence replies by throw-
ing the charge back on Luscius, who had borrowed, not
over intelligently, from two plays of Menander, the
Phasma and the Thesauros, and by citing the eminent
examples of his predecessors Naevius, Plautus and
Ennius. 3rd, general poverty of style and diction¹⁵.
Is the stories told be true, Terence may have found
his detractors too strong for him: for to
escape their 118188811110118, 81, as others
suggest, to improve his knowledge of Greek customs
and language, he took his final and fatal journey to
Greece. He is supposed to have been drowned as
118 was returning home, bringing with him transla-

Η z’s death.
