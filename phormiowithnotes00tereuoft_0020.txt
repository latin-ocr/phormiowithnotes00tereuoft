the language and even in the vices of his characters
there should be nothing bizarre or unseemly: and
because he is truer to his originals, he is the fitter

to Menander, it is because he was consessedly the best,
and because we have from the fragments of his works
preserved to us ampler opportunity of judging of the
character of his comedies. In these there is little to
remind us of the Old Oomedy, familiar to us in the
pages of Aristophanes, though the Old Comedy is
often spoken of as though it were the lineal progenitor
of the Comedy of manners and intrigue which finds
in Menander its typical exponent. Aristophanes and
the Old Comedy belonged to a period at least a century
earlier, when Athens was in her full political and artistic
glory. In the perfect liberty which her citizens then

claim to honour and applause. About a hundred
years later Athens’ sun had altogether set: she was
