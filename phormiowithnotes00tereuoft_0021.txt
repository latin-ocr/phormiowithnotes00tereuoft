subjected to the yoke of foreign tyranny ε 1161 political
life was over ε her citizen forces were metamorphosed
into ι5011111615 of fortune': nothing was left but the
53113 of Attio wit and the eminently Greek power of
enjoying a sensuous, worldly life. To Mfflfflffl„ „⁵0-
this life Menander holds up the mirror. 342-291.

As we might expect, in the development of his plots
love is a principal factor.

Fabula iucundi nulla est sine amore Menandriff.

With an iteration which to 501116 minds¹⁸ 15 almost
wearying, he tells 115 of the sorrows and schemings of
some forlorn lover, the artifices of his favourite slave,
the anger or pettishness or niggardliness of his father,
the wiles of his mistress and so forth. But there 15
more in Menander than this. A pupil of the great
character-painter Theophrastus, 3 contemporary and
intimate of Epicurus, he was well fitted to bequeath
us 3 living picture of the manners of his age, and,
better still, to give a lively embodiment to types of
character which are as universal 35 1111111311 nature.
Menander-'s plays are 3 stndy of the 500131 life of his
time: they tell 115 how his contemporaries dined, chat-
ted, flirted: describe their piques, prejudiCeS, little
odd ways, their tastes and fashions¹93 and the life he
draws 15 not 50 remote from our own that we have
any difficulty in placing ourselves (m rapport with 1115
6163110115. Given a western civilization of developed
comfort, and Menander’s favourite characters will be
sure to play their part upon the stage of life. Men
are at all times gourmets²⁰, lovers, pleasure-seekers:

μήσατο; Α11513οΡ11. Gram.

2⁰ This aspect is well brought out in the table-talk
preserved 130 us in Athenaeus, who uses the Middle and Nexv
Comedy to illustrate his points.
