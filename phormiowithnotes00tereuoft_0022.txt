so long as youth tries to enjoy itself, parents are
anxious, old men querulous and unreasonable, women
seductive‚ parasites fawning and servants impudent,
Menander and his imitators will survive. An eye for
character, the knack of life-like portraiture3 these
Menander had3 and besides these the strain of pen-
siveness‚ the undercurrent of musing melancholy, which
finds expression in terse maxims and reflections upon
human lifem.

This is the great master whom Terence set himself
Terenoe‘s lan· to reproduce for a Roman audience²². In
yuaye. one point at least he has, by universal
consent, succeeded: in oharm of language he is second
only to his original: he has just that restraint which
most pleased a Greek: he is master of his words, even
when feeling is deepest²³t his metres are carefully and
skilfnlly handled, consonant with the sense, flowing
easily in narrative, and proving no check to the ap-
preciation of pathetic passages: so that we may safely
combat the criticism of Quintilian, who seems to think
that Terence transgressed the bounds of Greek se-
verity3 for he says of his writings ‘plus adhuc habitura
gratiae, si intra uersus trimetros stetissent'24. Fui-ther,
his idiomatic Latin25, except in the occasional use of
γλῶτται (1.6. words transferred bodily from another

²¹ Notice especially ‘life is a fair’ in the ’Τποβολιμαῖοςε and
the well-known saying, ‘whom the gods love, die young ⁷.

²2 In detail, the plays are: Andria, from Menander’s Andria
and Perinthia. Eunuchus, from Menander's play of the same
name and the Κόλαξ. Adelphoe from Menander's Ἀδελφοί and
Γεωργός and a scene from the Συναποθνῄσκοντες of Diphilus,
Heautontimormnenos, from Menander’s play of same name.
Hecyra, from Apollodorus and the Ἐπιτρέποντες of Menander.

Phormio, from Apollodorus.
2³ The exception to this is a tendency to pleonasm: see

notas, passim: but Plato, a master of style, is pleonastic.
²⁵ Tgigiicelqhxiiself (Heaut. prol. 46) claims pura oracio as a
characteristic.
