effect Terence is undoubtedly wanting: on the other
hand he fairly sulfils the definition of wit ‘chastened
insolence’‚ as given by Aristotle³²z his humour con-
sists in contrast of character rather than in exuberant
fun such as characterises the farcical imitation of
Mouza-ew. There is however plenty of briskness and
life in the Eunuchus (what can be more entertaining
than the parasite's account of his method of gaining
a livelihood ῗὶ); in the closing scene of the Phormio
and in the third act of the Adelphoe, where Demea’s
sententious remarks and righteous maxims are echoed
and pai-odied by the slave Syrus3 while the dry hu-
mour of the scene in the Phormio with the foolish
advisers is of no ordinary quality³⁴. If tragedy and
comedy are to be defined by the denouement, then
Terence is undoubtedly a comedian3 but his comedies
are mainly of the sentimental kind: they belong to
what the F rench call ‘genre serieux' and ‘comedie
larmoyante’: there is a want of mirth (especially in
the Hecyra and Heautontimorumenos) and the pathos
is at times almost painful: witness particularly the
touching opening of the Andria.

We turn next to the handling of the plot. Here
Plots. Terence exhibits considerable skill, except
that his trick of making the heroine almost invariably
turn out to be an Athenian citizeness becomes a little
worn by frequent use. He is hampered too in point
of simplicity by the custom of contaminatio already
alluded to. The use of two or more plays to construct
one produces a want of unity in the plot: and this is
objectionable, because if the principa] plot is first
evolved‚ the rest of the play is uninteresting3 if the
