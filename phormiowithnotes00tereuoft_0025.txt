inferior plot, the characters come in afterwards in a
meaningless way³⁵. F urther, too great prominence is
sometimes given to the episodic characters (προτατικοὶ
πρόσωπα). Βι11 we may say that as a rule the posi-
tions are not farfetched, the intr-igue is simple and the
whole arrangement true to the reality of life.

The life depicted was, we must remember‚ a foreign
one; and we cannot too highly praise the Reprmmagion
careful study which Terence must have ⁰f Greek Hs&
made of his miginals, to reproduee so accurately as he
does the spirit of the Greeks. We should hardly have
expected him to have entered nicely into details of
custom and fashion, or abstruse points of Greek law:
we could have forgiven him, if now and again in slave-
life, or marriage ceremonies, or in the law of divorce
he had appealed to popular knowledge and not to the
prevailing cus-‘coms of Greece. But such forbearance
on our part is uncalled for: the more closely we ex-
amine our author, the more strict shall we find him
to have been in making his drama a reproduction of
the ordinary life which Menander and his contempo-
rai-ies porti-ayed. Now and then there are traces of
departure from the original 1ο satisfy Roman sentiment,
just as, for convenience or variety, the relationships³⁶
and names of the characters, the opening of certain
scenes³⁷‚ details of desel¹iption³⁸‚ «lac, may differ from
the Greek model. Thus, a woman in childbirth
appeals to Iuno Lucina ; we find reference on the
same occasion to the presence of freeborn women:
allusion is made to 1116 sacrificial uerbena³⁹ (vervaffl), to
