courtesan, parasite, &c., who are presented to us'ss.
To accomplish this with success 11 13 necessary that
each character be drawn out consistently with itself
ancl true to the principa] lines of real life. Taking the
Phormio as illustrative‚ we see Dorio representing the
ordinary slave—dealer, blunt, decided, bullying‚ a keen
and surly trader looking to profits and quick returns—
we see Phormio himself, a gentlemanly adventui-er,
careful rather of a reputation for shrewdness and tact
than for honesty, unsorupulously intriguing for the
gratification of sels, but nice and discriminating in the

study of a man at heart a miser, grasping after the
money which he has paid to redeem his own and his
son's honour. Geta, the favourite confidential slave,
typifies the life of one serving two masters 3 for he

way, quick at finding fault even with those who are
trying to serve them, frightened at their fathers, but
ready 10 fool them ‘to the top of their bent'.

Again‚ in the Adelplcoe nothing can be more ad-
mirable than the contrast between the two brothers:
1116 father all anxiety for 1116 fate of his boys, making
himself by his rigour universally unpopular, obliging
deceit to conceal his foibles in 'that son whom he keeps
under his own charge: on the other side 1116 bachelor
uncle, who has the other son to live with him, an
easy-going jolly fellow, full of the maxim ‘boys will be
boys', and carried away by his annoyance with his

of Plautus, but without his severe criticism:
Adspice quo pacto partes tutetur amantis ephebi,
ut patris attenti, lenonis ut insidiosi, 816.
