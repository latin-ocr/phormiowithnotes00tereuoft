INTRODUOTION. xxv

brother to indiscreet praise of immorality⁴⁹. This uncle
at the end of the play is induced by his good-nature to
marry a woman of mature years: an inconsistency
which rather spoils the perfectness of the delineationffl'.
Beyond this, it is hard to take exception to the character-
painting of Terence: Diderot, indeed, considers the
old man in the Heautontimorumenos as overdrawn:-—
no one could be So utter a monomaniac or so distress
himself for the absence of an undutiful son—and
possibly the slaves throughout are not quite true to
their position: their language is too polished and their
manners unnaturally gentlemanly: but slaves were
not always of low birth, and the particular class de-
picted in Terence is that of the master's confidant.

The effect of these sketches, so far as they achieved
anything beyond amusement for the honr, Probable effect
was in some respects wholesome: there on the specta-

in the Adelplzoe, one openhanded and tolerant, the other
hard and close, of inculcating the doctrine of the
golden mean, and recommending a moderate license of

extraction. The Romans might find a lesson of cul-
ture and politeness in the generally gentlemanly tone
which pervades the comedies, and in the representa-
tion οἱ slave life a hint of something still higher‚ an
inducement to gentleness and hunianity. But in the
main the tendency‚ we cannot but sear, was downwards
rather than upwards,· vice is there though it is more
refined than that to which the Romans were as yet
