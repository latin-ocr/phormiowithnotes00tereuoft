THE TEXT OF TERENOE.

The materials out of which the text of Terence is
to be reconstructed in its original perfec· Text maceriazs
tion are, roughly speaking, of two kinds: sor'r’econszrucc-
viz. (l) the manuscript copies of the text, ²⁷¹9·

(2) the references and quotations of early writers. AS
however no copy professing to be perfect has reached
us, we are obliged also to give some weight to the con-
jectures of modern scholars. And indeed many of the
various readings of more recent codd. are themselves
but the conjectures of scribes, and that too at a time
when critical sagacity was at its lowest pitch. By far
the most copious and valuable source of evidence is
that derived from the MSS. Here we must draw a
hard and fast line between Ood. A [the Tne codices.
Bexnbine] and all the rest. The extant codd. are very
numerous, but only nine are thought by Umpfenbach
worthy of special collation.

Of these MSS. A alone is free fron] the recension
of the grammarian Calliopius [Tth cent. A.D.], whose
name is appended to all others, V contains only frag-
ments of Andria and Eunuchus.

The ΒΕΜΒΙΝΕ codex is so named from having be-
longed to Cardina] Pietro Bembo in the Codex Α.
second half of the xvth century. It is an uncial, and
consisted once of 14 quiniones: the beginning and end
however are wanting. It begins at Andr. 787, but is
much torn up to Andr. 888.
