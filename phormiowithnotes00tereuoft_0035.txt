this the case in Latin ⁵⁷ 3 and chiefly in the language ol?
the people, of which the writings of the comio poets
[Terence however less than his fellows] are a more 01·
less faithful representative, and against the slackness
of which the language of the classical writers of the
Augustan age working on Greek models is an emphatic
protest. This tendency of Latin to shorten the final
syllable is a decisive argument against those who hold
that e. g. senex dari should be pronounced s'neae cl⁷ri⁵⁸
rather than εεηέαε αἀνῖ. But the examples quoted below
will show that such shortening is by no means confined
to the last syllable: and we must remember also that
in early times double letters were not written, which
accounts for e. g. 806 intell. 666 supell.⁵⁹.
