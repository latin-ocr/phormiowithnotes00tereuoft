the bringing out of the plays, resting mostly on the authority
of M. Terentius Varro and other grammarians. Here A reads

acta ludis ‘Acted at the Roman games when L. Postu-
mius Albinus and L. Cornelius Merula were Curule Aediles.
Acted by L. Ambivius Turpio. Flaccus the slave of Claudius

Aedilibus Cur, These magistrates were entrusted with
management of public games and theatrical representations;
probably having like our Lord Chamberlain the authority to

The decision of such a point they would relegate to some
competent critic. Hence when Terence offered his Andria to
them they referred him to Caecilius. Suetonius’ Life of Terence,

may trust Terence's compliment, who helped on the success of
Caecilius; and to him as an ambassador Terence entrusted
the 2nd prologue when the Hecyra had been hustled off
(Hecyra, 2nd prol. q.v.); cf. Cic. Cato Maior ξ 48 Ut Turpione
Ambiuio mayis delectatur qui in prima cauea spectat, delectatur
tamen etiam qui in ultima, eac.
