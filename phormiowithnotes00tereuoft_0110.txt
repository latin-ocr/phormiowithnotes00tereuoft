Ambiuius Turpio L. Atilius Praenestinus) But L. Atilius
belongs to a later representation, [as Dz. says] perhaps one of
13.c. 141. He comes into the didascaliae of Andr. Eun. Heaut.

claudi, sc. serum. Slaves were often very accomplished,
the Roman citizen disdaining all singing, dancing‚ &c., as in-
consistent with his typical virtue yrauitas. This is especially
shown by the ius uirgarum in histriones which empowered the
Praetor to soourge actors. Cicero (p. Arch ξ 10) contrasts
Archias with the ‘scaenicis artificibus? Livy (7. 2) implies
that these histriones were not citizens, could not serve as
legionaries, and became infames, nominally at least, until quite
late times. The sole exception to the rule is in the case of
Atellano fables. ‘Eo institutum manet ut actores Atellanarum
nec tribu moueantur et stipendia tanquam expertes artis ludicrae

faciant!

tibis inparibus. We may conceive roughly the appearance
of the tibicen by picturing a man with two stunted clarionets
in his mouth. If both were dextrae or both sinistrae they
were called tibiae pares The dextra had a shrill treble, the
sinistra a deep bass tone3 these tones indicating the change
in the character of the drama. The comedy tibis imparibus
would imply a change from stataria to motoria, ‘from grave to
gay, from lively to severe’, and this corresponds with the alter-
natione in the Phormio. Don. states the exact opposite with
“ regard to dextrae and sinistrae, but the ‘tibis duabus deoetris'
in the Didascalia of Eunuchus, the merriest of the plays of
Terence, seems conclusive against him. Cf. Hdt. 1. 17 αὐλοὶ

comedy, came from Carystus in Euboea. Terence is said to

have borrowed the Hecyra also from him.

Epidicazomenos, the title of A.'s play rather than -mene,

menos eiusdem Apollodori'. But it is not safe to say w. Bentl.
