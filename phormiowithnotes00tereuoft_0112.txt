76 P. TERENTI PIIORMIO.

fecit se. noster poeta. [Bentl. ante hic, to avoid the subject
offecit being the old poet. Hic often used by Ter. of himself,
e.g. Heaut. 19, 233 Ad. 10, 28; Phorm. 20.]

6. adulescentulum. On the u with which the word should
be spelt, see Ritsohl Proleg. ad Trin. p. xcv.

As to the allusion we know nothing. Terence’s literary
taste disdained any approach to burlesque. Perhaps some
such stripling as the Menaechmus of Plautus (as Wagner sug-
gests) is intended.

7. sectari. Frequentative verbs are especially frequent in
the comic poets: sometimes stronger than the primary verb,
sometimes not. Cf. e.g. infr. 34, 99.

9. intellego, not intelligo. Ritschl Prol. ad Trin. p. xcvii.
So Νοῃῖθῃεγε, aequeparare are the right forms. See Munro on
Lucr. ⁴2.951,1205; 3. 239—where he adds perenm, interemo,
accedit, recepit. See the note on Andr. 15 in Cambridge ed. of

quom stetit olim. Bentl. (reading olim cum stetit noua)
held that -it cannot be lengthened except it be contracted.
But profuit Hec. 463 [where Bentl. profuit immo uero obfuit}
Cf. Lachm. (pp. 75 sq.)‚ and Munro on Lucr. 2. 27 fumet aurem
5. 1049 sciret animo, both which Lachm. disallows. Nettleship
exhaustively treats the matter in an Excursus on the lengthen-
ing of final syllables, Conington's Vergil, vol. 3. It would seem
that originally the quantity of -z‘t final was common. Peile,
p. 325.

Stare used of a play being successful—as in Hor. Ep. 2. 1.

176 caelat cm recto stet fabula talo. Hec. 15 partim sum earum
exactus partim vix Steti.

11. laedo, esp. used of malicious libels, e.g. ‘ Quom saepe
laederentur dabunt malum Metelli ’. Afran. fr. 374 laedo inter-
dum contumeliis.

[The old edd. inserted between vv. 11 and 12 a line et
magis placerent quas fecisset fabulas which, out of place here,
evidently comes from Andr. 3. Being omitted by the best
codd. it was condemned by Faernus]

14. posset, so Bentl. [1³ with E, see Umpf. ad h. 1.] for the
reading of the codd. potuisset-,3 proloyus in Latin always
lengthening its first syllable, though connected with Greek
πρόλογος. So propino (προπίνω) in Martia] ; propola (προπώλης)
in Lucilius; cf. prdpello Lucr. 4. 1053 Prfiserpz'na.
