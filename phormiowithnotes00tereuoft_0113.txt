NOTES. 7 7

15. Guyet suspected this vs. and Ihne, Ritschl, ἀφ, con-
demn it. But its worthlessness does not seem clear. Bitschl's
objection that the poet could not be said dicere proloyzmz. is
hardly convincing. The vs. however may be a gloss brought
into the text from the margin. As to apparent tautology Ter.
is somewhat given to pleonasm: see infr. vv. 80 nil quicquam,
108, 471, 648, 649, 733, 7343 Hec. 10 nemo illorum quisquam.

16. is sibi. ‘ Let him have this for answer3 that all who
meddle with literature have an open prize to contend for‘.
The excuse for the attacks on a rival being that success in
comedy means a livelihood, failure starvation.

17. ars musica. corresponds to the wide μουσική of the
Greeks, which is the intellectual side of education, the physical
being γυμναστική, Heaut. 23 studium musicumzliterary profes·
sion. Cf. Hec. 15, 38.

In all these cases the worclzliterature, of which the drama
was at Rome a prominent representative.

18. reicere. Cf. Verg. Ecl. 3. 96 reice capellas with Con.’s
note. The Latins said reicio or relacio, not reticio, disliking
the coming together of the ii.

19. Cf. the verse quoted from Menander's Ὀλυνθία. ὡς

οὐχ ὑπάρχων ἀλλὰ τιμωρούμενος. Eun. 6 Responsum ozon dictum
esse quia laesit prior.

20. audisset bene. So ἀκούειν εὖ, κλύειν εὖ are frequently
used, especially in Greek tragedy : see Liddess and. Scott, s. V.
Milton's (Areopagitica, p. 240 ‘hears iu²=has a bad name
(see Hales' note) is sornewhat similar.

21. For similar omission of the copula esse [see however
critical note] cf. infr. 316, 349, 467, 725, 777, 787, 792, 1033. Dz.

rel-latum, i.e. entered to his account, a metaphor from con]-
mercial transactions [assimilated from recl-latum. Donat. h. 1.]
Verg. Aen. 1. 30 relliquias Danaum. So recl-amo, red-eo,
red-duco (infr. 86 and Munro on Lucr. 1. 22& 2. 1001. Lach-
mann's commentary on Lucr. 5. 614, p. 303); red-do, ree-
cidere. The prcfix though it usually appears as re· was
originally red. Brix, Plaut. Capt. 915.

22, 23. iam—non facit. This, the old reading, gives a
satisfactory sense. ‘ As Lanuvinus will not put an end to the
quarrel I will? The emphatic mihi and transitional force of
nunc (v. 24, cf. Lucr. 1. 110 et saep), passing to a main point
from a secondary one, favour this. We need not take Don.’s
