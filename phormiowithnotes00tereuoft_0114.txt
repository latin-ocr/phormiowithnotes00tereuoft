explanation ἀπὸ τῆς ἐπιεικείας τοῦ λέγοντος, nor understand
‘patientia paene Christiana¹ which displeased Bentley. Rather
‘tired of him Iget to my real point'. Bentl.’s tum—fecerit which
rewrites the passage is too violent, but makes good sense.
‘Then will I make an end of speaking concerning him, when
he shall, &cst Most modern texts read a query with Stallbaum,
‘ Shall I be the first to make peace? '

quom concessive and adversative (as Dziatzko says) in
Plautus are construed with the Indicative, in Terence with Ind.
and Conjunctive. Cf. Eun. 243 nil quom est. Ad. 166 indiynis
quom sim acceptus modis.

24. nouam. Note that this word ean be applied to the
play though but an adaptation : it could be applied even to the
Hecyra on its third representation [Hec. prol. 5 Num: haec
plane est pro noua} A good example of the use of the word
nouus as opposed to recens is given in these places, and also infir.
245 Ne qaid horum umquam accidat animo nouom. [A curious
illustration of the question occurs in the action for dramatic
libel brought by ΜΓ Reece against the Theaire newspaper,
reported in the papers of February 21, 1879. Mr Tom Taylor
said, ‘ There was nothing wrong in calling an adaptation new.
There was a recognised distinction between new—and new
and original. He had written about ten adaptationS, and no
doubt some of these had been described as new’.]

25. Epidicazomenos. See note on Didascalia.

26. Graeci, Latini nominant. Bentl. Id uero miraculi
instar est, si iam Latini nominant Phormione-m, priusquam acta
fuerit, priusquam eam coynouerint'. So he reads Graece-—
Latine hie (4 n.) Phormionem nominat. This is perhaps better
Latin, but not what Ter. wrote. He quotes several passages
to show (1) that Graece Latine is better than Graeci, &c.; (2)
that poets named their own plays, e. g. Plaut. As. 12 Huic
nomen Graece Οηαῃο esi fabulae. Demophilus scripsit Maccius
uertit barbare; Asinariam uolt esse si per uos licet. Cas, 31;
Mero. 1Ο; Poen. 53; Trin. 18-21 [which however is perhaps
not genuine, Liebig de proll. Ter. et Plaut. p. 39].

27. primas partis aget, i.e. he was to be protaqonist.
Owing to the infrequent use of masks on the early Roman
stage it was not possible (as it was at Athens) for one actor to
take many parts. Doubtless that of Phormio was taken by
L. Ambivius Turpio at the first representation, by L. Atilius of
Praeneste at a later revival. With respect to the use of masks
