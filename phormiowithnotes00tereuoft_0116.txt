80 P. TERENTI PHORMJO.

the stage before time ’. The didascalia of Hec. as once read
stated it to have been acted A. U. 594 (Β. c. 160) at the funeral
games of L. Aemilius Paullus: whilst the Phormio came out
B. c. 161. But this refers to the second (and unsuccessful)
attempt, the first having taken place A. U. 589 (B. o. 166).

motus loco. Locus may be a metaphor from military
matters, ‘ driven off the field’. Hor. Ep. 2. 2. 30 loco deiecit,
which Orelli explains by ‘castello depulit’. Forcell. explains
it as a figure from gladiators or wrestlers, where he who causes
his adversary to shift his ground is sure of an easy victory3
which is not so good. Locus seems also to have been used as
a t. t.=‘the stage '. Cf. Verg. Aen. 7. 332 Ne noster honos
irffractaue cedat Fama loco.

33. actoris uirtus. It was excellent policy for Terence
[know'mg as he did that his plays were not likely to please the
people at first] to be on good terms with his actors. To judge
from the prologue to the Hecyra, the ‘pleading’ of a good
actor had the greatest possible weight. See supra 10, and the
proll. to Heaut. and Hec. At Athens where the poet's stand-
ing was more defined the compliments were paid to the
audience.

uirtus may refer (1) to the eaccellence of the acting, or (2)
to the pluck with which Ambivius again and again tried to win
the favour of the people. The connexion with uir perhaps
points to this latter signification.

34. adiutanszadiuuaots. Of. supr. 7, note.

Dauos is a πρόσωπον προτατικόν, brought on merely to intro-
duce the play, and coming on only in the wpdraffcszthat part
of a play before action begins, opposed to ἐπίτασις and κατα-
στροφή. Don. on Andr. 1.

35. summus. ‘ My most intimate friend'. It means this
even without amicus. Eun. 271 summum suom. Cf. infr. 1049,
Ad. 352, Nam is nostro Simulo fuit summus.

popularis Perhaps ⁶ fellow-countryman’. If Davos=
Dacus, the Daci and Getae being conterminous, both might be
looked on as Thracians by Romans not too strict about their
geography. Cic. ad Att. 10. 1. 2, Ego uero Solonis popularis,
cui, ut puto etiam mei, lenem ozeyleyam. The lexicons take it
=‘fell0w-slave ', comparing populares coniurationis Sallust
Catil. 24. pop. sceleris ib. 22; where see Cook's note.

36. ratiuncula—pauxillulum. The diminutives showing
the¹ paltry amount of the sum enhance the force of the passage,
infr. 43 n. So conraditur, scraped together.
