NOTES. 8 1

37. rel1cfiom. Former edd. read relliquom. But the word
was not trisyllabio until the silver age. Munro on Lucr. 1.
560. Lachmann’s Comm. p. 305. Ritsehl on Trin. 14.

38. (he begged of me) ut conficerem. Enipse.

39. erilem. Attributive adjectives are osten used in Latin
and Greek where our idiom employs a possessive case. Sullanus
exercitus; Variana clades ; Τελαμώνιε παῖ.

40. ei munus hoc conraditur. On the first txvo days
after the wedding presents were received by the newly-married
pair. See Guhl and Koner Lebm der Griechen und Homer,
p. 192 (English Translation).

41. inique (opposite of aeque. Note on prol. 30) ‘What
an unfair arrangement it is ³.

i. Ritsehl (Trin. Prolegomena p. xcvii) allows the forms
ei, z·; εἰς, is: disallows ii, iis, as well as diri, diis.

minus habent. Litoteszfiffffov ἔχουσι. The genius of the
Greek [and to some extent also of the Latin] language con-

stantly understated anything untoward. Cf. ἥκιστα, minime,
by no means.

beck’s Comie Fragments, passim}

Uncia=w of any whole. Literally ‘an ounee at a time ’,
and so used Plin. N. H. 28. 9. 37 aanmyia datm-...unciatim
It is esp. effective here as being saved out of the meagre
allowance of far, oil, salt, with a little wine, which was given
out to slaves usually monthly‚ sometimes daily [Hor. Ep. 1. 14.
40 cum seruis urbana diaria rodere mauis, rodere being used ‘ de
duro tenui parco seruorum urbanorum uictu'. Orelli. Martial
11. 108 pueri—diaria poscunt} The allowance was in early
times not given, for slaves ate with their masters, but on
separate benches (Plut. Cor. 24). For the ‘ ueteres Maurorum
epimenia bulbi '‚.ef. Juv. 7. 120 with Mayor’s notes there and
at 3, 167 ; 14. 126 Seruorum uentres modio castiyat iniquo.

43, 44. The two verses form a studied climax. ‘ What the
poor wretoh ounee by ounee with miserly stinting has hardly
spared from his rations ' all this is to go at one fell swoop.
