82 P. ΤΕΕΕΝ TI PJJORMIO.

It is probable that Ter. has mixed up Greek and Roman
customs with regard both to slaves and the presents. A Greek
slave was often hired out, and was allowed to work on his own
account, paying his master a fixed sum whatever his gains—as
some cabmen now.

43. demensum is of course ‘that which was measured out',
from the supine stem of demetior, having nothing immediately
to do with mensis a mouth, from which it is sometimes ab·
surdly derived. Yet the two words are doubtless connected.
Cf. Gk. μήν. Curtius Grundz. d. G. E. 471.

44. defrudans. Ritschl prefers both srudo and defrudo,
ad Trin. 413. Here A and four others of Umpfenbach’s MSS.
have -u-: at Trin. l.c. codd. have -αιι-, Ritschl himself substi-

tuting srudauz'. Cf. the corresponding forms in causa, accus03
claudo, cludo. Corssen Ausspr. 1. 660 sq. Roby ξ 250.

genium. Root GEN (as in γίγνομαι, yemis, ἀει). A man's
own sels: and hence in the popular imagination a kind of
guardian angel [Hor. Ep. 1. 7. 94 Scit qenins, &c.]‚ the com-
panion of his sorrows and joys from the cradle to the grave.
Hence to act liberally or niggardly to the genius is equivalent
to self-gratification or self-denial. Plaut. Truc. 1. 2. 8 Isti qui
oum gleniis suis bclliyerant parc-[promi. Aul. 4. 9. 15 Egomet
me defrudaui animumque meum [seniumque meum, where arn. q.
m, dcc. are merely exegetical of me. So maenium infr. 70.
It is the peculiar bent of mind which gives each man his
separate identity. The following passages illustrate the point.
Hor. Od. 3. 17. 14 Cras aenium mero Curubis. Juv. 4. 66
Genialz's αῃαϊιιν Iste dies. Pers. 5. 151 Imlulye ι(μήῖο.

conpersit. Better form than comparsit. Parsit occurs
Nov. 78; Ribbeck's Com. Fr. pp. 18, 266; pao-cuit Naev. 69.

46. quanto labore partum. Note the omission of the
copula, sit. The expression comes very near to being an ex-
clamation. Dziatzko compares infr. 84, 256, 264, 611, 612.

47. ferietur munere, ‘ will be in for another present when
his mistress has a child'. R.G.J. Cf. the metaphoric use of
deuerberasse infr. 327; of mactare, 1028. In Plaut. Trin. how-
ever it means little more than cheat. Cf. Turpilius, 36 [Rib-
beck] αι etium ineptus meus mi est iratus pater, quia se talento
argenti tetigi veteri exemplo antemium. Prop. 5. 44 cum serit
astutos comica moecha Getas.

ubl era pepererit. At Athens on the 10th day after birth
the child was named, being publiely owned by the father as
legitimate, and toys were given to the child, painted vases to
the mother. Guhl and Koner, p. 195.
