NOTES. 83

48. natans dies. Both Greeks and Romans kept birth-
days sacred to the genius. The festivities were so luxurious as
to become proverbial. Mayor on Cic. Phil. 2. 15 (Antonius)
dat nataliciam (se. cenam.) in hortis. Presents were uni-
versal: men offered to the geniuffi women to J uno. ovid, Tr.
3. 133 5. 5. Martial 8. 64 laughs at Clytus for having eight
birthdays—ut poscas Clyte memus eoeigyasque Uno nasceris octiens
in anno. The health οἱ dead friends was druuk on their birth-
days in the choicest wine—quale coronati lerasea Heluidiusque
bibebant Brutorum et Cassi natalibus, Juv. 5. 36. Birthday
cakes were iu vogue. Ov. Tr. 4. 10. 12 Una· celebratast per
duo liba dies. Conington on Verg. Ecl. 3. 77.

48, 49. dies‚ ubi imtiabunt. There has been much dis-
cussion about the nature of the initiation referred to. The
usual reading places a colon at dies: with the comma the cere-
mony would be on and not after the first birthday, and we may
accept the explanation that it refers to the weaning. Don.
quoting from Probus who again refers to Varro, initiari
pueros Eduliae et Poticae et Cithae, Dinis edendi et potandi et
cubandi ubi primum a lacte et α cwnz's transierunt. Wagner
thinks that the allusion is to· the child's admission to the
sacra ,· acting on a hint given} by Don. that the Samothracian
mysteries are intended, which seems most improbable. We
may compare Juv. 3. 187 where the favourite slave dedicates
his hair to a god, and the clients bring cakes: Plena domus
libis uenalt‘bus. [Madame Dacier objects to the suggestion of
the initiation being that to Edulia‚ dcc„ because this was a cus-
tom purely Roman while the play is entirely Greek. But it is
by no means clear that Ter. always slavishly adhered to his
originale. In fact, this intentional change may have laid him
open to the charge of imperfect education and knowledge of
Greek, which we know to have been imputed to him. See

Sueten. vit. Ter. and Heaut. 23 uetus poeta dictitat, Repente ad
studium hunc se (1de icasse musicum]

49. auferet. ‘ All this the mother will pocket’. A strong
word to be used by a slave of his friend’s future mistress.

50. causa, πρόφασις, a seigned pretext. So often in Terence,
eg. infr. 2343 Hec. 80, 693. It might be either true or false,
Suet. Iul. 30 Et praetentam quidem illi ciuilium armorum hoc
snm causas autem alias fuisse opinantur, where it is opposed
to praetextum as true to false.

51. siquis me quaeret rufus— Sentence broken off. ⁴11
any red-haired fellow shall ask for me— '.
