84 P. TERENTI PIJORMIO.

The Romans being dark joked at the red hair of their slaves.
The actor who playcd Davus‘ part would wear a red wig. Wigs
called ,qalearia [from their likeness to a helmet] were some-
times worn instead 01 masks (personae). Red was the conven-
tional colour for slaveS, black for young men, white for old.
In this play we judge from vv. 209—212 that masks were not
worn. Cf. however Don.'s pref. to Ad. ‘ haec acta est agentibus
L. Ambiuio, dcc„ qui curn suis gregibus iam tum personati age-
bant ¹. When once introduced they came into fashion. Masks
sometimes presented different expressions on different sides.
Cf. inf. 57, 890; Tcuffel§ 16. 9; Quint. Inst. Orat. 11. 3, 11.
Forty—three different types of the persona comica are enumerated
distinguished by features, complexion and wigs; viz. nine for
old men, ten for young men, seven for male slaveS, three for
old women, fourteen for young women. Rich, Dict. Ant. s. v.
persona q. v. He makes the sweeping statement that a mask
was always worn.

52. conabar. ‘ Ah, Ι was just starting to find you’. R.C.J.
Either esse or a similar word is needed to complete the sentence,
or conabar is used absolutely, *Ι was anxious to meet you’.
Don. mentions both explanations.

em is to be distinguished from en and hem, with which itis
often confused in codd. Ritsehl ad Trin. 3: ‘Em A: quam
formam, cum iam in Mercatore—ut Plautinam tuitus essem
suscepissemque, uindicauit postea Brixius et q. s.’ Bentl. had
already made the distinction in his Ten, but it was ignored by
Fleckeisen. It is originally the Acc. of the demonstrative
pronoun is and is partly demonstrative, partly interjectional.
Ribbeck, pp. 29, 54. A of Plautus (the Ambrosian) and A of
Terence (Bembine) agree in making the distinction. See Rib-
beck, Com. Fr. index, s. v. Em, hem, also Ritschl’s Trin.
index, s. v. Em.

53. lectumst. ‘'Tis good money’ (picked and therefore
good). Don. quotes a VS. of Lucilius, Lecti omnes; Atticon

hoc est. Plaut. Ps. 1149 Argenti lectae numeratae minae.

conueniet. ‘You will find the amount just meets my debt.'
For this use of the future cf. Mayor on Juv. 1. 126, Noli
uexare; quiescet (you will find she's asleep).

54. amo te. A formula of thanks frequent in the comio
poets. Cf. inf. 478, omnis uos amo. Plautus and Ter. use
