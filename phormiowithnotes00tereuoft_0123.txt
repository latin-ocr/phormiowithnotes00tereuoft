business lay in superintending the moral mining, taking
their young masters to school and such offiees. Plato, Rep.
373 c, classes them with τιτθῶν τροφῶν κομμωτριῶν κουρέων.
Cic. Lael. 74 nutrices et paedayoyi. The office was given to
the most trusty slaves, At Rome the post fen into disuse, but
young picked up slaves were carefully trained to be the com-

panions of their masters‘ children, and called paedayoyiani .-
Rich, s. v. paedayoyiani.

magistrum may be used either of the paedaqogyus or of the
praeceptor. Varro, ap. Non. 447. 33, Educit obstetrix, educat

nutrix, instituit paedayoyus, docet orzayister. Cf. the use of
monitor, infr. 234.

prouinciam. ¹Ah, Geta, that was a ticklish post? R.C.J.
A political metaphor. The word freq. so used in comio
poets. [See Classical Review, July 1888, p. 227, where the der.
is given from stem prov. Provineus, provincia analogous to
vicinus, vicinia ; literally: ‘ lordship⁷.]

73. usus. Some MSS. usu. Bentl. points out that either
construction is allowable.

74. deo irato meo. ‘I see now that the trust was a freak
of my evil genius' R.C.J. Andr. 666 Deos satis sciofuisse iratos,
inf. 636 Satin illi di sune propitii? I'haedr. 4. 19. 15 1)ιέ est
iratis natus qui est similis tibi. Naev. Stalagmus. Ribbeck,
Com. Fr. p. 18 Deo meo propitio, meus homost. Don. ad l.
‘ Videtur (Terentius) addidisse meo ne esset ἀμφίβολον cui dice-
ret irato deo'. Cf. Juv. 1. 49 Exsul ab octaua Marius bibit et
fruitur (lis Iratz's.

76. seni. Bentl. conj. senibus because both had left him
in charge. This is somewhat hypercritical.

scapulas. Frequently used in comio writers, and in con-
nexion with flogging; eg. Plaut. As. 315 Ergyo mirabar quod
dudum scapulae gestibant vrihi.

scapulas perdidi. ‘True to my master Ι betrayed my
shoulders ’. Of. Plaut. Epid. 1. 1. 84 corium perdidi.

77. istaec: namque inscitiast. Reading so (1) we shall
be able to give the words as they formerly were given, to
Davus. (2) istaec will have its proper meaning of ‘that
maxim of yours’. [For the form of the word istaec see note on

infr. 170. Bentl. constantly isthaec, trying to force together
iste and haec]

namque has best MS. support, and is therefore preferable to
Fleckeisen‘s namquaezquaenam: for which see infr. 732.
