86. sectari. ‘Dangle after her ’. Note the use of the
frequentative.

ludum. A school for teaching any subject, literary or
otherwise. The girl would learn instrumental musio, which
came under the wide μουσική. Afterwards the word was almost

usurped by the training-schools for gladiators. Cf. the deriva-
tion of school (σχολὴ, leisure).

01 redducere. ‘ Escort her to and from school’. See note on
.. supr.

Ritscffl ⁶ Ilico non illico libri et hic et alibi constanter'.

ffico. The variant ei loco arose from ilico not being under-
stood. Cf. Gell. 5. 6 (7). 7 ita (i.e. eoeaclzcorsmn. See Bentl. ad
h. 1.) oportere apud Ter. legi dicebat in his uersibus: Ιη quo
haec discebat ludo exaduerswn loco Tonstrina erac quaedam.

89. tonstrina, represents tond-tr-ina‚ cp. King and Gook-
son, p. 208. FL, Wagner, dcc„ read tostrina. But though no
doubt this represented the pronunciation of the word, the
MSS. agree in keeping the n. [The nasal η was frequently
lost, and before -str-: in Verg. we find mostrum, trastrurn for

ἰζιοηδέᾙιωη, transtrum. Ritschl Trln. 342, &c. reads mostro with
ut .

tonstrina was not merely a barber's shop [condem clip;
rado, shave]‚ but the place where much of the toilet was per-
formed, viz. cutting and dressing the hair, cutting the nans,
pulling stray hairs out with tweezers. Romans seldom shaved
themselves the wealthy keeping slaves for the purpose. The
tonstrina being thus frequented was, like the balnea of later
times, a fashionable lounge, like κουρεῖα at Athens [and
Florence, see George Eliot's ‘Romola']. Ar. Plut. 337 Myosy’
