90 P. TERENTI PH ORMJ Ο.

may be translated into English by using ‘shall'‚ ‘should’‚
‘can'‚ ‘could’, or a periphrasis, e. g. Cic. ad Att. 7. 1. 4 Ea·-
pecm, amabo te, dum Atticum conueniant, ‘to allow of my
meeting A.' Dum=‘until' of a simple expression of fact
usually takes the present indicative. Haut. Most. 683 Eyo hic
tantisper, dum exis, ze opperiarsoris.

91. 1111. ‘There'. The locative of ille used adverbially.
Don. ‘illi pro ibi. ut illi mea tristia fata’‚ Verg. Aen. 2. 543
(where it is really dat. after narrare). So isti (Plaut.), illi-c,
isti-c, Izi-c, peremi, temperi, ὥσ. Roby, ἓ 524. Bentl. here
reads illic w. later MSS.

interuenit. Ter. here quits his original. Apollodorus
makes the barber himself enter and say that he has been cutting
the girl’s hair for her mouruing, which (as Don. says) would
offend Roman sentiment. For Greeks used to crop (κείρεσθαι)
their hair, Romans to let it grow, inf. 106 capillus passus,
Liv. 1. 26 soluit crines, 6. 16 multos mortales capillum ac
barbam promisisse.

92. mirarier. ‘We fell to wondering'. [Roby‚ ἐξ 614,
615, suggests that this form of the infinitive arose thus: the
ordinary passive suffix r, in the form er, was added to the
active inf.‚ whose final e took the form of i before er. Then
the r would be dropt because of its ill sound after another ν
(Roby, ἓ 185) and ie contracted to i. Thus amare—er, amarier,
amarie, αιη(ι]·ῐ.] This form in -ieris occasionally found in poets
of the classica] period, e.g. Verg. Aen. 11. 242 sarie& Hor.
Odes, 4. 11. 8 3])(ιι·ῃίει·.

93. rogamus quid sit. ‘ We ask what‘s to do'.

94. paupertas uisumst. ‘Never did poverty seem to me
such a wretched crushing burden'. Res. The participle is
attracted into agreement with the predicate. Such sentences
as Quas yeritz's uestes sordida lana fnit, OV. A. A. 3. 222,
are on the same principle. Bentley disliking the constr.
read with Priscian, 2, p. 94 uisa est, which is an obvious
correction.

95. hic uiciniae. ‘Hard by here’. These words are
locatives in apposition with each other. Cf. Andr. 70 huc
uiciniam. Cf. Roby, ἓξ 1091, 1092, 1299. Pl. capt. 382 Ut
adhuc locorum fecit faciam sedulo. Heaut. 110 ¹istuc aetatis.
Cf. hoc noctis (PL), id aetatis (Cic.); Madv. Gk. Synt. ξ 50 b;
Plato Rep. 403 ὅπου γῆς. [At Andr. 1. c. huic read by BCDEGP
is caused by inability to understand the constr.]
