97. ea sita erat exaduersum. ‘ The corpse was laid out just

when any exists between this abl. and the gen. of quality, is
that it embraces less than the latter. The Engl. rendering of

and Dem. are merely assuming an appearance of courage.
Another suggestion is that moral quality is expressed either by
gen. or ab1., physical by abl. only. But this is subject to
many exceptions‚ e.g. Ιηῃεήιιί uoltus puer inyenztique pudoris.

ἓ 1309, says, ‘The genitive (nearly related to the genitive ot*
possessor, dcc. ἕ 1278) is used rather of the sort or quality ; the
abl. of the special characteristics and condition. Thus the
genitive (and not the abl.) is used of specific measurements of
what a thing or person requires, and of the class to which it
belongs. The abl. and not the gen. is used of the characteristic
parts of a thing or person (especially of the bodily parts), and
of its temporary state. Both (though in Cic. chiefly the abl.)
