123. confidens. Cic. Tuso. 3. 7. 14 Qui sortis est, idem
est fidens: quoniam confidens, mala consuetudine loquendi, in
uitio ponitur, ductum uerbum α confidendo, quod laudis est. Id.
Caec. 10. 27 Sex. Clodius, cui nomen est Phormio, ‘nec minus
ἠῐῃεν nec minus confidens quam ille Terentianus est Phormio.
Whilst confidens is always used in bad sense, confidenter is
sometimes used in praise.

qui, common in execratione, lit. ‘in which respect’, ‘ by
ἓέῗάἒὲῗιε token'; cf. e.g. Plaut. Trin. 923 Qut istum Di

125. lex est ut orbae. When an Athenian had but a
daughter to inherit his estate she was styled ἐπίκληρος. If the
father died without a will she had to marry the nearest rela-
tion, who appeared before the archon to give publio notice3
if no one opposed the suit, the archon was bound ἐπιδικάζειν,
the suitor for the girl's hand being ἐπιδικαζὸμενος, she herself
ἐπίδικος or ἐπιδικασθεΐσα. But if the nearest of kin deolined
the match he had to provide her with suitable dowry. See
Demosth. adv. Maoartatum (ed. Reiske, p. 1067), τῶν ἐπικλήρων
ὅσαι θητικὸν τελοῦσιν, ἐὰν μὴ βούληται ἔχειν ὁ ἐγγύτατα γένους,
ἐκδιδότω ἐπιδοὺς, ὁ μὲν πεντακοσιομέδιμνος πεντακοσίας δραχμὰς,
ὁ δὲ ἱππεὺς τριακοσίας, ὁ δὲ ζυγίτης ἕκατον πεντήκοντα πρὸς

Cf. infra, 439, dicam irzpinaere——infn 329, 66& Plaut. Aul.
753: Cio. Verr. 2. 25 scribitur Heraclio dica. Terence
occasionally uses γλῶτται, i.e. words transferred from another
language: e.g. techinazrdxvm ἰοῃίελόγοις colophos, Ad. 199.

129. iudices. At Athens the case woqu come before the
Archon, at Rome before the Praetor.

130. ‘how she's related to you, all this 1'11 invent ’.

quiesced, it was done, a trial, a defeat, a wedding‘. Ros]
