157. quod, διο. Usu. explained as the accus. of respect,
but perhaps it is the abl„ in a causal sense, with the old pro-
nounced d, used also by Cic. ad fam. 14. 4 quod utinam minus
uitae cupidi fuissemus.

159. aliquod, as read by A, = aliquot. So Eun. 151, 539;
Heaut. 752; Ph. 312, 8323 so also quod=quot‚ Heaut. 916,
932; Ph. 327, 454, 705; Hec. 817; Ad. 92, 535, read also by A
and the best MSS: the distinction between the words was not
clearly marked till Imperial times. Dz. holds that d should be
read everywhere—but not so Corssen, Ausspr. 1. 193.

160. audio, ‘Yes‚ yeS‚ I understand’: said impatiently.
161. Connected in construction with Antipho's last words.

162. tibi—dolet. For impers. use of doleo with dat. cf. Eun.
430 dolet dictum iuprudeuti, Ad. 272 and Plaut. Men. 2. 3. 84.

163. amore abundas, ‘You are embarrassed by bliss '.
166. ‘I am ready to pay my lise down> for it ’. R.C.J.

depicisci morte. Abl. of instrument. cf. Cic. ad Att. 9.
7. 3 cum euim tot (pericula) impendeant, cur uon honestissimo
(periculo) depicisci velim? [Or, abl. of price3 the usual rule
that the price paid is in abl. and the real value in genitive
will hardly hold: for we are met by such examples as
tanti, melani, quanti, dcc. Notice in one line in- Juv. 7.
178 balnea sescentis et pluris porticus. On the other hand,
if the normal value or price as conceived in the mind is to
be in gen„ how are we to account for minimo, paullulo, &c.‘?
See Heinrichs‚ de usu abl. apud Terentium, Elbingae‚ 1859.
Roby, ἐξ 1186, 7, explains tanti, magni, parui, plurimi, nihili,
διο. as locatives: but this does not account for pluris, minoris,
maioris, huius, unius assis, effic. Cf. Charis. p. 109 (Keil),v
“plura aut minore emptum antiqui dicebant: Cicero, ‘plura
uenit ’‚ et Lucilius ‘plure foras uendunt ², sed consuetudo ‘pLuris ‘
et ‘minoris '‚ clz'cit”. May the original use have been the loca-
tive, which afterwards, being misunderstood or corrupted in
form, parted off into gen. and abl.? Grammarians would of
course make a distinction, whether it existed or not]

cetera. Bentl. ceterum, ‘ unum enim erat, non plura, quod
coniceret '. Don. “aut ⁴ cetera' abundat, aut deest ‘ ut sit per
cetera .

168 sqq. ‘To say nothing of the fact that you have won,
without paying for her, a free-born lady3 that you posseSS‚ as
you wished, a wife publicly acknowledged and oi good repnte:
