quite happy but for one thing, the want of a temper to bear

168. liberalem ‘ a gentlewoman’ as opposed to Phaedria's
music-girl, whose visits to the ludus were to give her some
kind of education to enhance her value in the market.

170. modeste. Cf. Sall. Fragm. lib. 2 modestus ad omnia
alia nisi dominationem.

istaec. Iste with demonstrative affix -ce is declined like
hie, except that istud-c contracts into istuc. Roby, ἕξ 374,
375. Noni. fem. istace is found, and nom. neut. istoc: but ce is
never added to gen. plur.

171. quo, cp. aliis, 476 n.

172. plerique omnes, ‘That's everybody’s nature almost ’.
A favourite expression in early Latin (cf. And. 55, Heaut. 8303
Don. in And. l. c.). Omnes is added to strengthen and qualify
plerique. [Reisig (Vorl. iiber Lat. Spr. ἓ 455) suggests an
ellipse of uel wrongly’. Dz.]

ingenio. Supra, 70.

nostri nosmet paenitet, ‘We think ourselves failures’‚
R.C.J.‚ i.e. we are discontented with our lot: for the sentiment,
cf. Hor. Sat. 1. 1 opening lines, Qui fit, Maecenas, ut nemo
quam sibi sortem Ι sea ναῖίο dederit, seu fors obiecerit, inat
contentus uiuat, διο. Cf. Heaut. 72: Ov. Pont. 1. 3. 14.

nostri. Roby, ξ 1350, regards these forms nostri, nostri, &c.
as from noster not nos: Aul. Gell. 20. 6 has a long discussion
utrum siet rectius dicere habeo curam uestri (ιη vostrum. The
personal pronoun seems the more proper form, like Greek
ἐπιμελοῦμαι ὑμῶν. Among other passages, including this from
Phorm., he quotes Afranius, nescio qui nostri miseritur tan-
dem deus ; Laberius in Necyomanteia, ‘nostri oblitus est—and,
in plur.. Plaut. Most. pars uostrorumz to which may be added
Hec. 21ss quo quisque pacto hic uitam nostrorum exiyat.

173 sqq. ‘ Now you I think are to be envied, P. ;—-you are
uncompromised, can still think what you will do, hold to the
girl or let her go3 I’m in the wretched predicament that
Ι can neither resign nor remain in possession '. R.C.J.

175. retinere eam anne amittere. This is the happy
suggestion of Dz. who however now reads as Fleckeisen.

176. mihi sit. If ius is not inserted (with A and Dz.) then
ἰ is long in mihi, which is not common in Plaut. and Ter.
