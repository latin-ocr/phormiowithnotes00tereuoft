Ritschl Trin. ed. 2 marks the form in index with a query.
Later codd. (a) mihi eius sit: followed by Parry, Fleck., &e.,

who read mittendi for amittendi. (b) Guyet and Bentl. mihi
ius sit; so Umpf.

If eius be read, notice the purely substantiva] force of the
gerund: and cf. term. in -di with fem. in Hec. 372: see
Lucr. 5. 1225 poenarum φαλκ sit soluendi tempus adultum.

178. ipsus. An old form, frequent in comedians. Neue,
Lat. Form. 2. 145. Cf. istus, once in Plaut.

179. reperis So Dz, and Umpf., which makes the line a
trochaic octonarius 3 Bentl. suggests repereris; Fleck. and XVagn.
follow Lachmann's conjecture (on Lucr. 3. 1050) reperies.

180. te inpendent mala. ‘ Such horrors threaten you all
of a sudden, and you're so unprepared'. Of. Lucil. ap. Fest.
p. 161. 9 quae res me inpendent [Fest. me=mihi]. Other pas-
sages, as Lucr. 1. 326, and the parallel use of accido, incido,
δίο. (Plaut. Stich. 88), convey a purely physical meaning.

182. After this line, one is found in the codd„ which is
obviously foisted in from And. 208 quae si non astu proui-

dentur, me aut erum pessum dabunt. Don. makes no comment
on the spurious verse.

184. temporis punctum. ‘ Then I’ve just one moment for
my purpose'. ExaotlyzGreek στιγμὴ χρόνου. Of. Hor. Ep.
2. 2. 172 puncto—mobilis horae. So, ‘on the prick of noon’.
French, ‘ point du jour ’‚ ὣς.

ad hanc rem. ⁴ Ad deliberandum quod ago‘. Don.

186. laterem lauem. ‘ I should be washing a brick ': this
is the only instance of this prov. in Class. Latin. Cf. πλίνθον
πλυνεῖς, which Dz. suggests may have ended a line in Terence’s
Greek original. Cf. similar prov. Aristoph. Vesp. 280 λίθον
ἕψεις, and Angl. ‘to wash a blackarnoor white'. ‘Can the
Ethiopian change his skin?' ‘We wash a wall of loam,'
Hooker, Sermon 2. 19.

187. me excruciat animi. A locative. [Roby, ἐξ 1169,
1321, the gens· which are found are due (1) to Greek construc-
tion; (2) to false analogy] Cf. Ad. (310 discrucior animi, Eun.
274 falsus animi, Hec. 121 incertus animi, Plaut. Mil. Glor.
1068, Verg. G. 4. 491 uictus animi, διο.

188. nam absque eo esset. Plaut. Menaech. 1022 nam
absque ted esset, hodie nunquam—uiuerem. Dziatzko notes
that absque is used with abl. in Plaut. and Ter. only in hypo-
thetical sentences without si and with imperf. conj„ Hand
