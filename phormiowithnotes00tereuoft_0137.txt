supr. 22, note.

hoc nil est, ‘It's no use, Phaedria’ [hoc perhaps used con-
temptuously of Antipho himself. Cf. Cic. Verr. etsi hoc nescio
quid nuyatorem sciebam, so τοῦτο, Aristoph. Eq. 854, Ran. 73.]

ilicet, ‘ Come along ἐἰν-ε licet, as scilicet=scire licet. [Don.
says ‘semper ilicet finem rei significat, ut actum est: sic
iudices de concilio dimittebantur, suprema dicta quum praeco
pronunciasset ilicet, quod significat ire licet⁷.] Cf. Eun. 55
actumst, ilicet Ῑ Peristi.

209. On maskS‚ see note on 51.

210 sqq. Cf. Les Fourberies de Scapin, Act 1, sc. 4:
‘Scapim Allons! la mine resolue‚ la tete haute, les regards
assures. Octave. Comme cela? Scapin. Encore,un peu davan-
tage. Octave. Ajnsi? Scapin. Bon: imaginez-vous que je suis
votre pere qui ari-ive, et repondez-moi termement comme si
c'etait a lui-meme ⁷.

210. satine. Dz. gives these rules for affixing -ne or -η,
Ι, after consonante, naturally -ηέ, ΙΙ, after long vowels in (a)
words of more than one syllable -η, (b) monosyllables either -n
or -ηέ, ΙΙΙ, after short vowels (a) before vowels‚ as a rule, -ηέ,
(b) before consonants (α) when the word with the particle has
the verse accent -ηὲ, (β) otherwise -η, IV, after words in which,
before -ne, s has fallen out, simple -n (eg. ain, scin, censen,
sanun, poterin). Satine and potine are but apparent exceptions
to IV, being formed from sate -ne, pote ate.

212. et uerbum uerbo, par pai-i, ἀρ. ‘ See that you
answer him word for word, tit for tat '. Cf. fuller form, par
pro pari, in Eun. 445.

213. protelet, ‘don’t let him rout you with his furious
broadside’. R.G.J. Cf. Turpilius (Ribb. Com. Fr. p. 96)
patria protelatum esse saeuitia patris. See Lucr. 2. 531 undique

219. tu iam litis audies: ego plectar pendens. ‘ You’ll
get a wigging: Ι shall be strapped up and flogged ⁹. There is a
contrast of the master’s and. slave's fate as in Heaut. 356 tibi
erunt parata uerba, huic homini uerbera. Slaves were some-
times hung up by the hands, with weights attached to their
feet. Cf. infr. 250 and Eun. 1021. Floggings, wearing the
furca, κυφωνισμός [And. 865 quadrupedem constringimL work in
the country, banishment from the cook-shop and other city
delights‚ were the usual punishments.
