102 P. TERENTI PHORMIO.

220. fefellerit. The tense is in agreement with that of
the principal sentence, though the present might stand here as
in Heaut. 6458 nisi me animus fallit multum, haud multum a me
aberit insortuniflm. [Dz.]

223. aufer mi ‘ oportet ’‚ ‘ Should me no shoulds ’. R.c.J.
Cf. Juv. 6. 170 tolle tuum precor Hannibalem.

quin—inpera. In this sense quin (Ribbeck Lat. Part. p. 14)
is used (1) with indic.‚ e.g. Heaut. 832 quin accipi-s? (2) with
imper. (esp. in comedy) And. 45 quin tu uno uerbo dic. Cic. pro
Mil. 79 quin sic attendite, iudices.

225. in re incipiuntur, ‘at the beginning of our plan’.
R.C.J. The participle in -dus is virtually a pass. pres. So,
ante conditam condendamue urbem (before process of building)
Liv. pref. Vergil's uoluendis mensibus is 3 transl. of Homer’s
περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν.

226. uincibilem, ‘ sure of success ⁹, used in an active
sense. So placabilis infr. 961 and Ad. 608, tolerabilis (?)
Heaut. 205, iwrzpetrabilis orator Plaut. Most. 5. 2. 4, yenitabilis
Lucr. 1. 11 (see Munro), mactabilis (zzqui mactat) Lucr. 6. 805,
penetrabile friqus and telum Verg.; dissociabilis Hor.; exitia-
bilis Plaut.‚ Cic.‚ Liv.‚ Tac. 3 pernitiabilis Liv. , Tac.; reparabilis
Pers.; illacrimabilis (of Pluto) Hor.

227. nunc ipsast opus ea. Opus has a double constr. (α)
with the abl.‚ causal or instrumenta13 opus really=a work.
The phrase is equivalent to qua refiet opus? Cf. Germ. ‘es ist
ein Werk'. (b) It appears as an indeclinable adjective, e.g. infr.
557 quantum opus est amenti, loquere. This use may possibly
have arisen from the difficulty of judging in some passages
whether it was accompanied by a nom. or abl„ e.g. iam. hoc
opus esc: see Heinrichs de usu Abl.

229. in insidiis hic ero, ‘will lie here in ambush’. Cf.
Plaut. Pseud. 959 at eyo hic in insidiis ero. All the best MS.
authority is sor this reading: Bentley however reads subsidiis:
in the reserves, i.e. as it were in the ranks of the triarii, who
would advance only when the two front ranks wavered. This
reading (which is forbidden by the scansion) would perhaps
harmonize better with subcenturiatus in the next verse, which
:one introduced to fill up the complement of a regiment, οι·
to step into the place of 3 fallen soldier. Cf. Ribbeck, Com.
Frag. p. 72, Caecilius 229 nunc meae malitiae Ι Astatia [te] opus
est subcentmiare, i.e. come to the aid of, back up.
