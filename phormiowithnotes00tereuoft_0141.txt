NOTES. 105

259. suscenses is better than succenses, so sescenti, ecc.

262. ‘That he may find what a martinet he has made of
his easy old father ’. R.G.J.

lenem filum, διο. Notice contrast of lenem and acerrumum
brought out by their position.

265. unum quom noris omnis noris. So A. Bentl. says,
‘quanto gratius est haec simplicitas quam ista uarietas', viz.
of later codd. coynoris. cf. And. 10 qui utramuis recte norit
ambas nouerit.

266. ‘A is in trouble, B appears as his advocate ; when B’s
in a serape, A turns up, it's a joint-stock concern‘. R.C.J.

268. inprudens. ‘Unwittingly’.

269. cum 1110 haud stares, ‘You would never have backed
him '. Cf. forcible phrase in Liv. 26. 41 cum di prope ipsi cum
Hannibale starent. The more usual expression is ab illo, ab
illius parte. So hinc stas, Plaut. Men. 799. Verg. Aen. 12. 565
Iuppiter hac stat.

270. culpam in se admiserit, ‘has been guilty of anything’.
Phaedria is about to plead that Antipho was forced into the
marriage. Admitto looks to the moral hability, freely incurred,
committo to the overt act.

271. rei—famae. ‘ If it is true that A. has been guilty of
anything that amounted to gambling with his prospects or
character, Ι don't demur to his getting what he deserves, but if
may be some rascal took advantage of his own villany to lay
a trap for our inexperience and succeeded‚—is the fault with us
or the judges? They often rnulct a rich man from spite, or
give damages to a poor man from compassion '. ΒΕ. J.

273 sq. Cf. Les Fourberies de Scapin, Act 1, Sc. 6.

276, 7. adimunt—addunt. Sc. by their decisions. Cf.
the Mosaic regulation, Lev. xix. 15, aud the sentiment of
Antiphanes, καλῶς πένεσθαι μᾶλλον ἦ πλουτεῖν κακῶς Ι τὸ μὲν γὰρ
ἔλεος, τὸ δ’ ἐπιτίμησιν φέρει.

280. tua iusta, ‘the rights of your case'. Iusta is made

Ξ, 13ὀ1ἐ133131111νο and has an attribute joined to it. See Roby,

281. functus—officium. Funaor has an accus. in Terence,
without exc. [but see Spengel on Ad. 603, Brix on Plaut. Trin. 1].
Utor, fruor, dre. both accus. and abl. (of the means), see Roby,
§1223 liberalis, ‘gentle'‚ supra 168. There is all the more
plausibility in Phaedria's account, because Antipho was
naturally timid; he says of himself, non possum immutarier.
