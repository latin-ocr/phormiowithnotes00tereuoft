394. malfaciant. Lachm. (Comm. p. 129) scans Di tibi
male· and at Andr. 52 Liberius uiuendi, δια, which Wagner
writes librtas uiuendi, διο.

esses proferens = proferres. This construction, though found
in such writers as Sophocles [e.g. Ai. 588 μὴ προδοὺς ἡμᾶς Ὑένῃ],
is usual rather in the analytic stage of language. Cf. Andr.
501 ut sis sciens :ut scias.

395. auo—atauo. Direct lineal descent would of course
be the highest claim to an inheritance.

397. face. This longer form is usual in Pl. and Ter„
especially in eompounds, except those of fero. Edice, adduce.

[FAtb Plj Tr. 174 A alone has fac; ib. 1008 fac libri3 face,
a er.

398. cedo. In conversation a query is often put logically
but not grammatically dependent on another verb or sentence,
eg. on such expletives as dic mihi, uide, cedo, &e So often in
Plautus and Terence when later writers would make the query
dependent and use the subjunctive. Cf. our ‘ Tell me, where
are you? ’ Roby, ἓξ 1761, 1605, 1607. [-do, future imperative;
pl. cette=eedite found only in early scenio poets.]

399. quibus me oportuit. For omission of inf. see supr.
383 Eyo me neam· 447 Cratinum censeo.

405. solus regnas. Ad. 175 reynumne Aeschine hic tu pos-
sides? The title βασιλεὺς at Athens was almost as distasteful,
though for a different reason, as that of rex at Rome, and
was preserved only in ἄρχων βασιλεύς, with which cf. rex sacrifi-
culus. [⁴ Weu you're infallible '. R.O.J.]

406. apiscier. Heaut. 693 Deorum uitam apti sumus, where
also the majority of MSS. read the compound. verb.

For the law at Athens on this point of. Demosth. in Lept.
Ρ. 502 (ed. Reiske) οἱ νόμοι δὲ οὐκ ἐῶσι δὶς πρὸς τὸν αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ

407 sq. ‘ I’ve been victimized,—but sooner than go to law
or be bored by you, I'll assume she’s my relation ’.

Dziatzko compares Eun. 116 sq. (Mater) coepit—docere—,
ita uti si essetfilia.

410. dare. Note the active when we should have ex-
pected dari. There is an anacoluthon. the apodosis of the
sentence ought to have consisted of some such word as dabo.
