NOTES. 119

492. hanelare, ‘You're romancing’3 hariolus seems to be
a contemptuous name for a haruspex: ⁴ an entrail man'. For
a different derivation cf. in laws of XII. tables ni testimonium
fariatur inprobus intestabilisque and ‘ne-sarius, VVordsworth p.
511. The force of the word is well brought out in Cic. Att.
8. 11. 3 non hariolans ut illa cui nemo credidit.

495. cantilenam eandem canis, ‘you sing the same old
song ’. There was a Gk. proverb τὸ αὐτὸ ᾄδεις ᾆσμα. Cf. Soph.
Ai. 292 ἀεὶ ὑμνούμενα.

499. inpudentem. Bent. reads inprudentem, because inpu-
dens would be too strong a word for Dorio to use to a freeman:
just as he conjectures inprudentia Hec. 213.

500. ut phaleratis, διο. Phalerae (from Gk. φάλαρα, Pelle
p. 282) ornaments for show worn on the breast by soldiers, and.
by horses on the forehead and breast—in trop. sense ad popu·
lam phaleras Pers, Sat. 3. 30.

‘Can you be so reckless and shameless, Phaedria, that you
want to take me in with tinsel and spangles and get my slave
for nothing?’ Ros. ductes, with the notion conveyed by
phrase ducere uxorem, means ‘to take as a concubine '. So
freq. in Plaut. e.g. Asin. 164, Men. 4. 3. 20. Ducco also=‘ lead
by the nose’ in Pl. Mil. Glor. 93.

502, 3. ‘And then to think that this blow shouldn’t have
befallen me when A. had some love trouble on hand too ⁵. R.G.J.
Phaedria feels that A. might have had more sympathy if he
had not already got his wish and been married to Phanium.
With Wagner’s atque translate ‘to think that this trouble
should have been brought upon me, when Antipho was already

bgtglbeged ’ς but this ignores the congratulatory ο fortunatissimo
o .

2. Another interpretation which makes aliazalia leui
{tggrcshac de nuptiis quae est yrauissima is inconsistent with the

3. Stallbaum joins neque closely with alia=eaclem.

506. auribus teneo lupum. The Gk. proverb is τῶν ὤτων
ἔχω τὸν λύκον οὔτ’ ἔχειν οὔτ’ ἀφιέναι δύναμαι, found in Aristae-
netus, lib. 2, ep. 3, though the latter part is probably explana-
tory of the proverb. In Suet. Tib. 25, we find. simply lupum
auribus tenere and the introductory nam in the spurious line,
here, nam neque quo pacto a me amittam neque uti retineam seio,
points to the same conclusion as to the orig. words of the
proverb. Wagn. suggests a reference to 176 supr.
