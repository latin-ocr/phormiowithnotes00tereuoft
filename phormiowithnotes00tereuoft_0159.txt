ground for reading the deponent: but this may be a participle
formed on the analogy 01 ausus, gauisus, dac. The form fatisco
is in use, and the arrangement of words is exaotly that of A.
Boot is ΕΑ in fa-ti90‚ fames, ad-fa-tz'm‚ χάτις.

592. uenio. ‘I went to the fellow to tell him money was
wanted’, historic present. Cf. Heaut. 492 dum id quaero tibi
quifilium restituerem.

597. ubi Phaedriae esse, dcc. In A letters are lost: the
lineis restored by transposing sese and esse. Bent. reads ubi

Phaedriai ostenderet nihilo mimis amicum se esse, (ἐζ-ο. Lachm.

Lucr. ἶ». 374 [p. 161] shows that the form -az‘ in Terence is not

601. belua, ‘Why am I such a lubber as to be scared?'
Plaut. Trin. 952 ne tu edepol me arbitrare beluam Ι qui quidem
non nouisse possim, quicum aetatem eaeeyerz'm. Cf. Fr. bete,
becise. Belua, not bellua, is the right spelling. Peile, p. 301.

604. a primo, ‘originally’‚ infr. 642. Of. Plaut. Most. 3. 2.

606. exp. quam... Roby, ἓ 1760.

609. Chreme. Vocative. The weak form [see critical
iggteg has more authority here and at Plaut. Trin. 617, see

610. uolup, ‘ I'm rejoiced’. The form uozupe is incorrect;
it was a neut. subst. [not the nent. of an old adj. uolupz's].
Enn. Ann. 7 quicum multa. uolop ac glandia. Plaut. Most. 155,
it is an adverb, victitabam uolup. Cf. facul. [Connected with
Greek ἕλπ-ις, ἕολπ-α Curtius, ξ 333.]

611. compluria. The more classieal form is complura, as
with simple plus: but see Aul. Gell. 5. 21. 6. In Plaut. and
Ter. we find only plura, and in Luor. [Lachmann on 2. 586]
plurima is read for pluria. Roby, ἓ 432.

614, circumiri, ‘to be got round', ‘cheated’. Plaut. Ps.
