&dilenggi above 604, and for insanibat, Roby, ἓ 607, infra

643. nimium quantum. Like the Greek θαυμαστὸν ὅσον.
Liv. 2. 1 mirum quantum. Hor. Od. 1. 27. 6 immane quantum.
See textual note for v. 1. libuit, on which Guyet remarks,
‘Altera quantum quod ob repetitionem superflua uideretur ab
ineptis librariis inepte eiecta est, et uerbum libuit in eius locum
ineptius suppositum’.

644. talentum magnum. Why great? Probably equiva-
Ient to our phrase, ‘a whole talent’ [24:243. 15s.], with per-
haps an allusion to the purity and consequent popularity of
Attio coinage. The epithet can hardly distinguish the Attic
from other talents from any intrinsic value, for the other talents
were larger than it3 e.g. the Aeginetan, which was in the
proportion of 82:57. There was however a small Sicilian
talent in gold with which this may possibly be contrasted.
See 789 infra. The combination tal. mayn. occurs Plaut. Rud.

immo malum hercle. ‘Nay (1²11 give him) the mischief

Ξιὸἀέιϊῑέεσεηεῖ. The fuller phr. locare (conlocare) in matrimonium

647. non suscepisse, ‘that I never reared a daughter': this
raising of the new-born child from the ground was a token
that the father acknowledged it, otherwise the babe was in
danger of being exposed. Chremes, like his namesake in
Heaut„ may have had and rejected a daughter, a common fate
of new-born children, esp. girls.

652. incommodum. The more usual construction with
uenire in mentem would be incommodi, which Bentley reads.
But the nom. is justified by Eun. 233; Heaut. 886 serui uenere
in mentem Syri calliditates, supra 77. See note on supra 154.

653. Cf. Plaut. Trin. 688 sqq. [BitschL ed. 2] Nolo eqo
mihi te tam prospicere, quia meam eyestatem tene& Sed ut inops
infamis ne sim: ne mi hanc famam differant, Me germanam
meam sororem in concubinatum tibi, Si sine dote dem, dedisse
mayis quam in matrimonium. See Aul. 224-233.
