NOTES. 127

677· repudium renuntiet. Repudium strictly refers to the
breaking of a contract before [ἐγγύησις], diuortium of one after
marriage. Diot. Ant. s.v. Diuortz'um. Plaut. Aul. 4. 10. 53,
54 LY. Is me nunc renuntiare repudium iussit tibi. Euan.
Repudium, rebus paratis, exornatis nuptiis. But the distinction.
was not always aecurately preserved. The Athenian law made
actual divorce on the woman’s side a very difficult matter.

680. Lemni, locative‚ ‘at Lemnos’3 Lemno [a reading men-
tioned by Don.] is ablative.

praedia, (1) property which was made a security to the state
by means of a ‘praes’, (2) land in general.

682. emunxi, ‘I have cleaned out the old men'. To wipe a
man's nose for him implies that he is a driveller and a fit subject
for cheating. Here alone used by Ter. but often by Plaut.

683. satin estid? A form of rebuke. Eun. 851. Geta

purposely misunderstands the question as though it referred to
the amount of the money.

686. ad restim res redit. ‘I’ve no alternative left but a
rope’. Caecil. Synepheb. Ad ‘restim res redi& immo collus
‘non res; nam ille amentum habet. Aesch. Eum. 716 (ed.
Drake); Soph. O. Τ. 1374 ἔργ’ ἐστὶ κρείσσον’ ἀγχόνης εἰργασμένα.

687. Bentley's reading adopted in the text is very neat, cf.
Heaut. 810 ut tc quidem omnes di deae quantum est, Syre as
Guyet and Bentley read it.

688. malis exemplis, Eun. 946 quae sutura exempla dicunt
in eum indiyna.

689. ‘Look here, if you please, here’s a pilot to take one
out of smooth water on to a rock’. R.C.J. It 15 difficult here
to decide which is the better reading. Although the words
quod quidem recte curatum uelis have much greater external
evidence in their favour [see critical note on this vs.] yet the
alternative qui te ad scopulum e tranquillo auferat is 5ο much
more effective that it is impossible not to accept it. Several
codd. contain both clauses. Bentl. points out that quod qu.
r. 6. u. 15 a gloss in all likelihood from Ad. 372. Wagner reads
both clauses, but this can hardly be right. Guyet has a
characteristic note, ‘ex hac lectionum uarietate hi uersus siue
tres siue quattuor instititii ac spurii uidentur atque hinc
ablegandi sunt’.
