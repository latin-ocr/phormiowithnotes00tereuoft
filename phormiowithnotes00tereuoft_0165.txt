707. anguis in inpluuium. Plaut. Amph. 1108 Deuolant
anyues iubati deorsum in inpluvium dno Maoezcmi. Eun. 589
[where also per inpl. was the old reading]. Theophr. c. 16
ἐὰν ἴδῃ ὄφιν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ, ἱερὸν ἐνταῦθα ἱδρύσασθαι.

inpluuium ‘ est locus sub eaelo in medio aedium relictus unde
lumen deorsum caperet: ita dictus quod eo implueret’. Varro.
Strictly it is a basin in the centre of the atrium into which the
water fell from an opening in the roof (compluvium). The

arrangement in Greek houses was much the same: cistern in
centre of the peristyle.

708. gallina cecinit, ‘Obseruatum est in qua domo yallz'na
canat superiorem marito esse uxorem’. Don. This is better
than to explain ¹qallz'na as a generic subst. including the cock,
as Wagner does, quoting passages from Chrysostom and Clement
of Alexandria.

709. haruspex, probably connected with χορ-δή : King and
Cookson, pp. 113, 176. ΡΘῘΙΕ, p. 359. The derivation from
ἱερου-κόπος is impossible. The hamcspioes consulted the entrails
of victims3 they were of Etruscan origin. On solemn occa-
sions they were invited to Rome, yet their art was never held in
much esteem by the more enlightened classes. Cato‘s saying
that no har. could look at his fellow without laughing is signi-
ficant in this respect, Guhl and Koner, p. 542. [Ilar'z'speoe‚ the
spelling of A, shows the middle vowel to be one of those sounds
intermediate between i and u for which the emperor Claudius
attempted to introduce the symbol Ι-·. Cf. Quint. 1. 4. 7
‘medius est quidem inter i et u sonus-⁷3 Mar. Victor, p. 2465
‘pinguius quam i, exilius quam u'. Prisc. 1. 6 ‘sonum y
Graecae uidetur haim-2³]

autem [the reading of all good MSS] led Fleckeisen to see
that two hemistichs had fallen out. Aliquid read by inferior
MSS. and-edd. is a mere stop-gap, serving also to help out the
gen. neyotz.

Bentley’s sontica. causa [cf. Tibull. 1. 8. 51 Parce precor
ωηεν-ο,- non illa sontica causast] is not likely to be right here.
Gruyet reads rem noui, comparing rem cibi=cibum (Phaedr.) ;
res uoluptatum (Plaut.).

The Atheniens considered winter months the best time sor
marriage.

711. ut modo fiant, ‘I only hope it may be so'.

me uide. ‘Rely on me’. Plaut. Trin. 8083 Mil. 3763
Rud. 6803 Asin. 1453 Ter. Andr. 350.

713. uerba dare ‘to cheat'. On the form duit supr. 123 note.
