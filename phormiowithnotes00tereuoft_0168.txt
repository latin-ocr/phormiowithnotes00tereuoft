132 P. TER-mm PHORMIO.

758. offendi, ‘I come home and light upon my daughter
married to the right person just as Ι wished ³, Heaut. 285.

759. uolebam—conlocatam. For constr. cf.Heaut. 26 omnis
uos oratos uolo. conlocatam gnatam. This seems the best
solution of a hard passage: it is less violent than Bentl.’s
filiam locatam. XVagan objections are not of much weight.
The MS. reading is hypermetrical.

761. hic solus. If haec sola [see critical note] be read
Sophrona is meant. But the words maxuma sna cura are not
applieable to her. The whole verse is awkward, and it is diffi-
cult to decide whether mamona is to be construed with the
preceding or following words.

765. audiemus. (Bentley's audiemus is to be understood
of the company generally: audietis would refer to Sophrona
and Phanium.) (The audies of the codices is a syllable short.)

ACT V.

766, 7. ‘By our own blunders we make it people’s interest
to be rogues, in our over anxiety to be called good and genereus ⁹.
The most ration al interpretation is that given by Madame Daoier
⁶ C'est par notre faute que des mechants trouvent leur compte
a etre mechants: car cela ne vient que de ce que nous affectons
trop de passer pour bonnes gens et pour gens commodes '.
This is confirmed by 770. Guyet, however, suggests ⁴ ut facili-
tatis et largitatis nos paeniteat et expediat nobis esse malos,
i.e. difficiles tenaces et parcos’. He regards 770 sqq. as
spurious, as he must do to justify his comment. See Kohl,
Comment. crit. in Ter. loca difficiliora.

malis. The evidence is fairly balanced between this readIng
and ηιαῖοε, the former is the more idiomatic.

768. ita fugias, ne praeter casam, sc. fuyiaa ‘ don't run
past the cottage’. Demipho complains that when he quitted
his normal miserly character he had fallen into a liberality
which was foolish. Cf. Varro lonye fztgyz't qui suos fuyit, the
idea being that a man's own house is his safest refuge: don’t
fly so precipitately as to sorget your natural shelter. This
interpretation best brings out the force of praeter. [Or tr.
‘Run for it, but not past your master's door’. Cf. Gronov.
Obs. 3, 9, p. 511 sq. A prov. found in this passage only:
it may refer to a runaway slave who would avoid above all
things coming near liis master's premises‚ ‘out of the frying-
pan into the fire’.]
