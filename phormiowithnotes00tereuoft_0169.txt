NOTES. 133

769. obiectum. ‘ thrown as a sop', as to a savage animal,
cf. Verg. Aen. 6. 419 sqq. cui uates horrere uidens iam colla
colubris Melle soporatam et medicatam fruyibus offam Obicit;
ille fame rabida tria ¹(Jnttura pandens Corripit obiectam. Liv.
4. 51 delenimentum animis Bolani ayri diuisionem obici.

770. qui, abl. ‘ wherewith’.

771. ‘Nowadays there’s a. premium on making straight
places erooked'. R.C.J.

772. mizilzic, a locative.

773. discedi, ‘1 only hope that this plan ensures success,
by his marrying her‘, used impersonally. Cf. infr. 1047 and
Cio. ad Att. 2. 16 sa· possum discedere (zeonsequi).

774. ut homost, ‘I'm really not sure, considering What the
man is, that he won't change his mind ³.

780. in eodem luto haesitas. ‘you're sticking in the mud
{figi-1525}- Plaut. Pseud. 984 perii nunc homo in medio meost,

uorsuram solues, ‘you will have to pay your borrowing'.
This is the reading of all MSS„ but is a very unusual phrase
and may perhaps, as Wagn. suggests, have come from con-
fusion with the kindred uorsnram facere, i. e. ‘minore fenore
acceptam 'pecuniam maiore occupare, Don. The common ex—
pression is votem-d soluere, which according to its der. from
τιον to implies a chanye of creditor (ef. qui uor tere solum), means
to borrow from B to pay A. Geta. means that he had got 1id
of the difficulty about Phanium by incurring a fresh trouble
with Phaedria’s business,

781. in diem abiit, ‘has disappeared just for the day'.
Cf. Cic. Phil. 2. 34 [see King s ed ] non solum de die sed etium

in diem uiuere. Id. 5. 9.1d. de O1at. ..40 169. Eun. 1020
Sed in diem istuc Pamnenostjo‘i tasse quod minare.

783. huius, this, Bothe's conjecture, refers to Nausistrata.
Palmerius’ conjecture senis not so good. Eius of MSS. (kept by
Umpf.) must refer to Phormio. Bent. reads Nauscratam neque
eius, but whence does he get Nuus-trata?

7 86. ae re, ⁴ You are aiding me now with your good offioes
ἓὲρξὲηὲξί as you helped me just now with your money '. Cf.

787. factum uolo, ‘ Ι am most happy’ ; formula to express
ready assent, Plaut. Bacch. 495.
