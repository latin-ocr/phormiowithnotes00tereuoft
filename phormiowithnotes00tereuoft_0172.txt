Roman custom of taking a slave, turning him round and push-
ing him away with the words, ‘huno hominem liberum esse uolo’.
At Athens a slave when manumitted passed into the condition

and in the leno's power: she would by being bought become
a ἑταίρα. See Mueller on New Comedy. Cf. Plaut. Cure. 203
