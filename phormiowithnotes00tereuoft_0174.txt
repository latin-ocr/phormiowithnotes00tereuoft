138 P. TERENTJ PHOEMIO.

874. somnium. ‘Moonshinc’ R.C.J. Ad. 204 de argento
sommum.

877. wandini, ‘happened to hear’3 found only in the per-
fect tenses, and always of hearing by chance; see Brix on
Plaut. Mil. 212; Ritschl Pron. p. 243 n.; Ribbeck (Com. Fr.
p. cix) quotes Plaut. Mil. 212, 442; Most. 5423 Mero. 941, 9443
Stich. 77 3 Aul. 264; Capt. 27 besides passages from the
fragments of Pacuvius, Afranius, Novius, and in Cic.

883. It is hard to understand how Guyet could have
displayed such a want of judgment as to condemn the con-
cluding spirited soenes of the play.

884 sqq. Faernus first made this a separate scene3 no
doubt rightly.

885. eludendi occasiost, διο. Notice the apparent change
in construction: the gerund is strictly active in sense and
equivalent to an inf. Madv. ἓ 419. For the inf. see Brix on
Plaut. Capt. 421. Phaedria would be anxious how to get back
money to repay the old men. See 535 supr.

888, 9. ingratiis, dcc. ‘As sure as this money has been
given to me, it shall be given to him, in spite of them. The
facts of the case have supplied me with the means of carrying
that point’. For ita ut Dz. suggests quod, which simplifies
the construction. The discovery of Chremes’ intrigue puts the
old men in Phormio's power.

890. See above 51 n.‚ on the use of masks.

891. angiportum, ‘iter compendiariam in oppido& Fest-

893. non eo. ‘I do not mean to go'.

896. estne ita, &a ‘lsn’t she ladylike as I told you?'
[In the MSS. this verse follows 905, where it is out of place,
Umpf. alone of modern edd. keeping it there. The order in
the text is due to Fleck. and is best, as the subject of the verse
is obviously Phanium. Bothe, not so well, placed it at the
beginning of the scene after 893]

898. dilapidat, ‘demolish’‚ ‘to make ducks and drakes of'.
Octavianus said of Antony, publicam dilapidat pecuniam.

903. quod recepissem semel. ‘What I had once engaged
to do ’. Of. Heaut. 1056 ad me recipio.- saciet.
